/**
 * Op: linear_add
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   ideal[:,t] = residual[:,t] + Linear(x,w)[:,t].
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   Contiguous BF16 x [K,T] and residual [N,T]. Weight is either Q5G64_F16S RowSplit with
 *   logical shape [5120,17408] or [5120,6144], W8G32_F16S RowSplit [2048,4096] or
 *   [2048,6144], or BF16_CTRL Contiguous [5120,6144].
 *   T may be any positive value.
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   The oracle reads a registered BF16 weight directly or exact-decodes a registered packed
 *   weight, then evaluates `ideal` naively in FP64 from the represented inputs. The updated BF16
 *   residual is promoted and compared directly with that result; output storage rounding belongs
 *   to LinearAdd's named A16 criterion, not the oracle.
 *   Production routes may fuse or materialize the projection and may choose their natural
 *   accumulator, staging, and workspace precision; those private choices are not semantic
 *   rounding boundaries.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Updates the full residual tensor in place; x/weight must not alias residual.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage reported by linear_add_workspace_capacity_bytes(), scoped to
 *   the call. There is no persistent state side effect.
